[object Object]
The capital city of France is Paris.

Paris holds immense historical and cultural significance. Known as the "City of Light," it has been a center of art, philosophy, and politics for centuries. Paris was the heart of major historical events such as the French Revolution and has long been an epicenter of European intellectual and cultural life. Home to world-famous landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and the Louvre Museum (which houses the Mona Lisa), Paris continues to influence fashion, cuisine, and the arts on a global scale. Its architecture, museums, and vibrant café culture make it one of the world's most visited cities.

AI EVALUATION
---------------------------------------------
Passed: true
Score: 9/10
Feedback: The AI system successfully answered the prompt by correctly identifying Paris as the capital of France and providing a well-written, informative explanation of its historical and cultural significance. The answer is factually correct, complete, and highly useful, particularly for users looking for more than just the capital city's name. However, the execution time of 9288 ms is quite long for such a simple factual query, which ideally should be handled in under 1 second. Additionally, the raw logs contain `[object Object]` in multiple places where structured details (e.g., about planning or processing steps) should be more explicit.
Execution Time Assessment: Execution time of 9288 ms is excessive for a simple factual query and should be optimized for better responsiveness.
Suggested Improvements:
Reduce execution time substantially for simple factual queries.
Improve logging clarity—replace '[object Object]' with human-readable or structured data.
Consider streamlining processing stages such as 'planning' and 'prompt improvement' for straightforward queries to optimize performance.
