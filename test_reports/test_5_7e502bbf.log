Here is a clear table listing the number of days in each month, with February's variation depending on whether it's a leap year:

| No. | Month      | Days in Common Year | Days in Leap Year |
|-----|------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| 1   | January    | 31                  | 31                 |
| 2   | February   | 28                  | 29                 |
| 3   | March      | 31                  | 31                 |
| 4   | April      | 30                  | 30                 |
| 5   | May        | 31                  | 31                 |
| 6   | June       | 30                  | 30                 |
| 7   | July       | 31                  | 31                 |
| 8   | August     | 31                  | 31                 |
| 9   | September  | 30                  | 30                 |
| 10  | October    | 31                  | 31                 |
| 11  | November   | 30                  | 30                 |
| 12  | December   | 31                  | 31                 |

Note:

- Leap years occur approximately every 4 years.
- A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, except for years divisible by 100 unless they are also divisible by 400.

AI EVALUATION
---------------------------------------------
Passed: true
Score: 9/10
Feedback: The system correctly interpreted the prompt and provided a clear, accurate, and complete table showing the number of days in each month for both common and leap years. The formatting is well-structured and easily readable. It also correctly distinguishes February's day count in leap years and includes a brief explanation about leap years. However, the explanation about leap years is cut off at the end, ending mid-sentence, which slightly detracts from completeness. Furthermore, execution time at nearly 12 seconds seems relatively long for such a straightforward lookup and formatting task.
Execution Time Assessment: The execution time of 11.857 seconds is somewhat long for a basic tabular response that requires minimal computation. Reasonable response should have been generated within 1-2 seconds.
Suggested Improvements:
Complete the leap year explanation fully, including the exception for years divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400.
Optimize performance to reduce execution time for such a simple data generation task.
Avoid truncating explanations or information in the output.
