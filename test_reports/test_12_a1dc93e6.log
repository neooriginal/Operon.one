AI EVALUATION
---------------------------------------------
Passed: false
Score: 2/10
Feedback: The AI system failed to produce a complete or usable plan for a weekend getaway to New York City within a $1000 budget. Although the step-by-step process seems to initiate with proper intent—cleaning the workspace, defining the prompt, querying for travel and accommodation costs—it never completes the execution of the task. Key planning elements are not delivered to the user, including itinerary, cost breakdown, or recommendations. An error ('Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '0')') indicates a failure in data handling or parsing during execution. There is no human-readable output or final summary, which renders the response practically useless to the requester.
Execution Time Assessment: Execution time of over 9 million milliseconds (~2.5 hours) is extremely inefficient for a simple trip planning task that should complete in seconds or a couple of minutes.
Suggested Improvements:
Fix the runtime error related to undefined properties—likely a problem with uninitialized or null variables.
Ensure the system generates and returns final output in a readable format rather than internal object references like [object Object].
Add error handling to prevent a total failure when a sub-task encounters a problem.
Reduce execution time dramatically, as over 9,000,000 ms (~2.5 hours) is wholly unacceptable for a simple planning task.
Ensure that extracted or queried data is parsed and presented meaningfully.
Provide a clear, human-readable summary of the itinerary, including travel options, accommodation, food, and activities with a cost breakdown.
