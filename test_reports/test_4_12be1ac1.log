[X] Ask about the traditional ingredients used to make a classic margarita cocktail, including specific types of liquor, citrus, and additional components.
[object Object]
A classic margarita cocktail traditionally includes the following ingredients:

1. Tequila: Typically made with 100% blue agave tequila. Blanco (silver) tequila is most commonly used for its crisp, clean flavor.

2. Fresh Lime Juice: Freshly squeezed lime juice is essential for the tart, bright citrus element of the cocktail.

3. Orange Liqueur: Common options include triple sec, Cointreau, or Grand Marnier. Cointreau is a popular choice in classic margaritas for its balanced sweetness and orange flavor.

4. Salt: Used to rim the glass. Coarse kosher salt is traditional, and adds a savory contrast to the drink's flavors.

Optional:
- Agave syrup or simple syrup: Added in small amounts if a slightly sweeter drink is desired.

A traditional ratio for a margarita is 2 parts tequila, 1 part orange liqueur, and 1 part fresh lime juice, shaken with ice and served in a salt-rimmed glass, either on the rocks or straight up.

AI EVALUATION
---------------------------------------------
Passed: true
Score: 9/10
Feedback: The AI system responded accurately and thoroughly to the prompt. It correctly identified the main ingredients of a classic margarita: tequila, fresh lime juice, and orange liqueur, and also included optional garnish and sweetener elements (salt for the rim and agave/simple syrup). The types of each ingredient were well explained (e.g., blanco tequila, Cointreau vs. triple sec), which enhances the usefulness and accuracy of the response. It also provided a common ratio for the ingredients, which is valuable for someone wanting to make the drink. There were no factual inaccuracies. The execution time, however, was notably high (over 12 seconds) given the simplicity of the task, which may suggest inefficiencies in processing or unnecessary overhead in the system's workflow. Additionally, there are minor verbosity and repetition issues in the logs (e.g., redundant '[object Object]' entries indicating potential logging or planning system issues).
Execution Time Assessment: Execution time was excessively long (12.4 seconds) for a straightforward query and could be improved through better system efficiency and less verbose initialization.
Suggested Improvements:
Reduce execution time by optimizing or streamlining pre-processing and task planning steps for simple factual queries.
Clean up system logs to remove or properly serialize '[object Object]' messages, which indicate poor handling of structured log data.
Trim verbosity in the system introduction (e.g., ASCII art) for faster initialization and cleaner log output, especially for simple information retrieval tasks.
