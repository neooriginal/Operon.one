Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world when measured from sea level, standing at 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet). It surpasses all other mountains in elevation above sea level.

In comparison:

- K2, also known as Mount Godwin-Austen, is the second-highest mountain above sea level, with a height of 8,611 meters (28,251 feet). It is known for its extreme difficulty to climb.

- Mauna Kea, located in Hawaii, reaches only 4,207 meters (13,802 feet) above sea level. However, when measured from its base on the ocean floor, it is over 10,210 meters (33,500 feet) tall, making it technically the tallest mountain from base to summit. Despite this, it does not surpass Mount Everest's elevation above sea level.

So, while Mount Everest is the highest mountain above sea level, Mauna Kea is the tallest overall from base to peak. K2 remains notable as the second-highest above sea level.

AI EVALUATION
---------------------------------------------
Passed: true
Score: 9/10
Feedback: The AI correctly identified Mount Everest as the tallest mountain in the world when measured from sea level, which directly answers the user's question. It also included a thoughtful and informative comparison with K2 and Mauna Kea, adding educational value and expanding user understanding. The explanation was accurate, clear, and well-structured. However, the response took 10.577 seconds to generate, which is longer than necessary for such a straightforward factual query, suggesting inefficiencies in execution. Additionally, the logs show '[object Object]' placeholders in several stages, indicating possible logging issues in the system pipeline.
Execution Time Assessment: Execution time of approximately 10.6 seconds is suboptimal for a direct factual query and indicates system inefficiency or unnecessary overhead.
Suggested Improvements:
Optimize the execution pipeline to reduce response time for simple fact-based queries.
Fix logging output to avoid '[object Object]' placeholders and ensure meaningful debug information.
Simplify response if the user question is direct and does not explicitly ask for comparative context, unless the added information is confirmed to be useful to the user.
